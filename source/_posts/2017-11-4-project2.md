When I worked at OmniTicket Network I wrote and edited API documentation for the TOR and BOS web services. 

<h3>BOS API</h3>

BOS is a point of sale solution for theme parks, museums, theaters, and other attractions. It can be used to sell tickets, reservations, and many other products.

The BOS API enables third party applications to sell tickets, make reservations, or perform other actions that are configured in BOS.

<h3>TOR API</h3>

TOR is an application that controls turnstiles.

The TOR API enables turnstiles to communicate with a venue's point of sale system. It can allow or deny entrance depending on factors such as ticket validity, biometrics, or guest entrance/exit counts.
