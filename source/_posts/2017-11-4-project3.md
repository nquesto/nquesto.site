At the end of 2016, my team was applying for an ISO 27001 certification. This certification demonstrates that our team has a systematic approach to managing sensitive information to ensure it remains secure.

To comply with the standards set forth by ISO 27001, I was tasked with producing a monthly security newsletter. The purpose of this letter is to communicate to customers about changes or updates to the product that affect security. To acquire this information, I interview management, support, and operations personnel at the end of each month. I distill their contributions into a letter and submit it for distribution.
