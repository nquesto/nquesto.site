One of my first responsibilities at Telit was to migrate the existing documentation library to a web based platform. The project had the following requirements:

1. The content needs to be re-written and re-organized for the web.
2. The readers need to be authenticated.
3. The content must be available offline.
4. The platform needs to be simple to use.

My mind went to Confluence. I never used it as a CMS, but I knew it could be leveraged to satisfy these requirements. Below is a summary of how I used Confluence to address these challenges:

<h3>Writing for the Web</h3>

My team's existing documentation was written for print publication. It was linear, author-driven, and intended to be read end-to-end like a book.

I needed to transform these books into web friendly content that was concise, searchable, and able to help users who had immediate needs.

I accomplished this by using Confluence to "chunk" concepts into smaller, more palatable pages. When complex concepts required a deep dive, I developed page heirachies with parent and children pages. Parent pages provided high-level views and enabled readers to navigate broad topics at a glance. Child pages, instead, provided specific information.

</a>

</a>

I also made use of Confluence's built in search functionality. This significantly helped translate the documentation to a web friendly experience. I included a search bar on the site's landing page and in each each manual. This feature provided the ability to locate specific terms or phrases across hundreds of pages.

</a>

These are just a handful of the techniques I used to migrate my team's documenation to the web.

<h3>Authentication</h3>
The secureWISE documentation I manage contains extremely sensitive content. As such, we required a documentation solution that prevents unauthorized access. 

To address this, I configured Confluence to require authentication for read access. Then, I created "user groups" that enabled me to assign permissions to internal and customer users. To supply authorized users with credentials, I developed a process and handed it off to the support team.

<h3>Exporting to PDFs</h3>

A big requirement was the ability to provide documentation that can be viewed offline. This was a head scratcher: *"You want a web based solution that can be viewed offline?"* Luckily, Confluence has a great built-in solution: PDF exports.

There was one wrinkle: generating PDFs mangled the layouts I designed for each page. My tables were cropped, the screenshots were too big, and the page breaks were inconsistent. My eye twitched when I saw my first PDF export.

To address this, I modified the PDF export's stylesheet. With a little CSS and HTML styling, my pubs were looking sharp once again.

</a>

<h3>Ease of Use</h3>
This is where Confluence really shined. It uses a WYSIWYG editor enabling anyone to jump in and contribute. This was extremely useful for receiving input from the development team. SMEs had to ability to highlight sections and add their comments straight to the page. To verify my work, I could provide QA with URLs to the exact paragraphs that were added or updated.

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
Overall, Confluence was an easy to use solution that met the needs of my team. That being said, it was not without its faults. It's a tool geared for corporate wikis and internal collaboration. It was rigid, limited customization, and stifled my creativity. 

But concise, accessible documentation is the name of the game-- and on that front Confluence delivered.
