        <title>Confluence to HTML</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After migrating my team’s product documentation to Confluence, I was presented with the challenge of making the content available in the product as an embedded help solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was tricky because the product (a web application) is primarily used in clean room environments where outside internet access is unavailable. This prevented us from simply linking the “Help” button to Confluence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prior solution was to generate a help file with Adobe RoboHelp that could be deployed to the clean room’s server and viewed offline. While this worked, it was difficult to maintain. If I made edits in Confluence, I had to make those edits again in RoboHelp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address this, I generated a static site using HTML exports from Confluence. After some experimentation and styling, I presented the solution to my team. It had a modern aesthetic compared to the antiquated look of RoboHelp. It was fully indexed and provided a search feature. It surpassed the look and function of the prior solution and, best of all, it enabled me to author content exclusively in Confluence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-row&quot;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Security Newsletter</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;At the end of 2016, my team was applying for an ISO 27001 certification. This certification demonstrates that our team has a systematic approach to managing sensitive information to ensure it remains secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To comply with the standards set forth by ISO 27001, I was tasked with producing a monthly security newsletter. The purpose of this letter is to communicate to customers about changes or updates to the product that affect security. To acquire this information, I interview management, support, and operations personnel at the end of each month. I distill their contributions into a letter and submit it for distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>TOR and BOS API</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When I worked at OmniTicket Network I wrote and edited API documentation for the TOR and BOS web services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;BOS API&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOS is a point of sale solution for theme parks, museums, theaters, and other attractions. It can be used to sell tickets, reservations, and many other products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BOS API enables third party applications to sell tickets, make reservations, or perform other actions that are configured in BOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;TOR API&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TOR is an application that controls turnstiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TOR API enables turnstiles to communicate with a venue’s point of sale system. It can allow or deny entrance depending on factors such as ticket validity, biometrics, or guest entrance/exit counts.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Content Migration to Confluence</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my first responsibilities at Telit was to migrate the existing documentation library to a web based platform. The project had the following requirements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The content needs to be re-written and re-organized for the web.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The readers need to be authenticated.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The content must be available offline.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The platform needs to be simple to use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mind went to Confluence. I never used it as a CMS, but I knew it could be leveraged to satisfy these requirements. Below is a summary of how I used Confluence to address these challenges:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Writing for the Web&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My team’s existing documentation was written for print publication. It was linear, author-driven, and intended to be read end-to-end like a book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I needed to transform these books into web friendly content that was concise, searchable, and able to help users who had immediate needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I accomplished this by using Confluence to “chunk” concepts into smaller, more palatable pages. When complex concepts required a deep dive, I developed page heirachies with parent and children pages. Parent pages provided high-level views and enabled readers to navigate broad topics at a glance. Child pages, instead, provided specific information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/confluence/tcsinstallch2.png&quot; data-lightbox=&quot;hierarchy_set&quot; data-title=&quot;Example of Page Parent and Child Pages&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;portfolio-thumb&quot; src=&quot;/images/confluence/tcsinstallch2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example of Parent and Child Pages&quot; style=&quot;max-width:45%;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/confluence/tcsinstallch.png&quot; data-lightbox=&quot;hierarchy_set&quot; data-title=&quot;Example of Page Parent and Child Pages&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;portfolio-thumb&quot; src=&quot;/images/confluence/tcsinstallch-thumb.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example of Parent and Child Pages&quot; style=&quot;max-width:45%;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also made use of Confluence’s built in search functionality. This significantly helped translate the documentation to a web friendly experience. I included a search bar on the site’s landing page and in each each manual. This feature provided the ability to locate specific terms or phrases across hundreds of pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/confluence/searchfunction.png&quot; data-lightbox=&quot;search_set&quot; data-title=&quot;Example of Page Parent and Child Pages&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;portfolio-thumb&quot; src=&quot;/images/confluence/searchfunction.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example of Search Function&quot; style=&quot;max-width:50%;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just a handful of the techniques I used to migrate my team’s documenation to the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Authentication&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secureWISE documentation I manage contains extremely sensitive content. As such, we required a documentation solution that prevents unauthorized access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address this, I configured Confluence to require authentication for read access. Then, I created “user groups” that enabled me to assign permissions to internal and customer users. To supply authorized users with credentials, I developed a process and handed it off to the support team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/confluence/conflogin.png&quot; data-lightbox=&quot;authentication_set&quot; data-title=&quot;Example of Login&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;portfolio-thumb&quot; src=&quot;/images/confluence/conflogin.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example Login Screen&quot; style=&quot;max-width:50%;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Exporting to PDFs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big requirement was the ability to provide documentation that can be viewed offline. This was a head scratcher: &lt;em&gt;“You want a web based solution that can be viewed offline?”&lt;/em&gt; Luckily, Confluence has a great built-in solution: PDF exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was one wrinkle: generating PDFs mangled the layouts I designed for each page. My tables were cropped, the screenshots were too big, and the page breaks were inconsistent. My eye twitched when I saw my first PDF export.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address this, I modified the PDF export’s stylesheet. With a little CSS and HTML styling, my pubs were looking sharp once again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/confluence/adminguidePDF.png&quot; data-lightbox=&quot;pdfexport_set&quot; data-title=&quot;Example of PDF Export&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;portfolio-thumb&quot; src=&quot;/images/confluence/adminguidePDF.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example PDF Export&quot; style=&quot;max-width:50%;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Ease of Use&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where Confluence really shined. It uses a WYSIWYG editor enabling anyone to jump in and contribute. This was extremely useful for receiving input from the development team. SMEs had to ability to highlight sections and add their comments straight to the page. To verify my work, I could provide QA with URLs to the exact paragraphs that were added or updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/confluence/inlinecomments.png&quot; data-lightbox=&quot;easeofuse_set&quot; data-title=&quot;Example of PDF Export&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;portfolio-thumb&quot; src=&quot;/images/confluence/inlinecomments.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example inline comments&quot; style=&quot;max-width:50%;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, Confluence was an easy to use solution that met the needs of my team. That being said, it was not without its faults. It’s a tool geared for corporate wikis and internal collaboration. It was rigid, limited customization, and stifled my creativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But concise, accessible documentation is the name of the game– and on that front Confluence delivered.&lt;/p&gt;
